# ControllingBrushlessMotorWithArduino

<h2>What is Brushless motors</h2>
<p>Instead of brushes and a commutator, these motors use electronic means (a drive circuit) to rotate the motor. </p>

<h2>How Does it Works</h2>
Before getting into the principle of the brushless mechanism, let’s first take a look at it’s components.<br>
This is commonly referred to as an electromagnet:



This will make the rotor start to spin as the permanent magnet experiences repulsion from the like-electromagnet and tries to align with an opposite permanent magnet on the stator.
Brushless ESCs need information on the current position of the rotor to be able to start the motor and choose a direction for the rotation.
Shorter frequencies allow a faster reaction time.
Furthermore, the Dshot protocol is different from the two others because it sends a digital signal instead of an analog signal.</p>
